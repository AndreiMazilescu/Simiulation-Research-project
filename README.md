Filename of simulation:
    sim_csv.py

This version outputs the sets with their respective seeds and balancing methods and writes outputs to csv files.

To run sim_csv.py, three csv files are required: a.csv, b.csv and c.csv.
Sim will output results to these three files and will overwrite them each time it is run.


Command to run sims:
```
# Install requirements: numpy and prettytable
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run simulation and output csv files
python3 sim_csv.py
```
